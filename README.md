# Medisync (A Patient-Management-System )


Medisync is a patient management system that allows medical centers to easily manage their patients. We are developing this as a Desktop Application using C# .NET Framework (Windows Form) for a university project under OOP in C# Module. To create an intuitive user interface, we utilized the Guna UI 2 Framework. The database was created using MySQL on a Digital Ocean server.
